__STANDARD MANDATORY NOTICE AND CONSENT PROVISION__\n\
\n\
By signing this document, you acknowledge and consent that when you access Department of Defense (DoD) information \
systems:\n\
\n\
You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) information system (IS) (which includes any device attached to this \
information system) that is provided for U.S. Government authorized use only. You consent to the following \
conditions:\n\
\n\
* The U.S. Government routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this information system for purposes \
including, but not limited to, penetration testing, communications security (COMSEC) monitoring, network operations \
and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.\n\
* At any time, the U.S. Government may inspect and seize data stored on this information system.\n\
\
* Communications using, or data stored on, this information system are not private, are subject to routine \
monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any U.S. Government-authorized purpose.\n\
\
* This information system includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect U.S. \
Government interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.\n\
\
* Notwithstanding the above, using an information system does not constitute consent to personnel misconduct, law \
enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications \
or data (including work product) that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, \
psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Under these circumstances, such communications and work product are \
private and confidential, as further explained below:\n\
\
  1. Nothing in this User Agreement shall be interpreted to limit the user's consent to, or in any other way restrict \
or affect, any U.S. Government actions for purposes of network administration, operation, protection, or defense, or \
for communications security. This includes all communications and data on an information system, regardless of any \
applicable privilege or confidentiality.\n\
\
  2. The user consents to interception/capture and seizure of ALL communications and data for any authorized purpose \
(including personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation). However, consent to \
interception/capture or seizure of communications and data is not consent to the use of privileged communications or \
data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation against any party and does not \
negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality that otherwise applies.\n\
\
  3. Whether any particular communication or data qualifies for the protection of a privilege, or is covered by a \
duty of confidentiality, is determined in accordance with established legal standards and DoD policy. Users are \
strongly encouraged to seek personal legal counsel on such matters prior to using an information system if the user \
intends to rely on the protections of a privilege or confidentiality.\n\
\
  4. Users should take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data that the user asserts are protected by \
any such privilege or confidentiality. However, the user's identification or assertion of a privilege or \
confidentiality is not sufficient to create such protection where none exists under established legal standards and \
DoD policy.\n\
\
  5. A user's failure to take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data as privileged or confidential \
does not waive the privilege or confidentiality if such protections otherwise exist under established legal standards \
and DoD policy. However, in such cases the U.S. Government is authorized to take reasonable actions to identify such \
communication or data as being subject to a privilege or confidentiality, and such actions do not negate any \
applicable privilege or confidentiality.\n\
\
  6. These conditions preserve the confidentiality of the communication or data, and the legal protections regarding \
the use and disclosure of privileged information, andÂ·thus such communications and data are private and confidential. \
Further, the U.S. Government shall take all reasonable measures to protect the content of captured/seized privileged \
communications and data to ensure they are appropriately protected.\n\
\
* In cases when the user has consented to content searching or monitoring of communications or data for personnel \
misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching, (i.e., for all communications and data \
other than privileged communications or data that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, \
psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants), the U.S. Government may, solely at its discretion and in \
accordance with DoD policy, elect to apply a privilege or other restriction on the U.S. Government's \
otherwise-authorized use or disclosure of such information."
