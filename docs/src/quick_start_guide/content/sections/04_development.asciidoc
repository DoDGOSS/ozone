=== Additional requirements

* NodeJs
* Python
* Cloned ozone GitHub repository
* Docker (optional)

=== Starting the frontend

.Start using Node.js and npm
----
ozone/ozone-framework-client$ npm install
ozone/ozone-framework-client/packages/application$ npm install
ozone/ozone-framework-client$ npm run start
----


=== Starting the backend

.Start using manage.py
----
// Install all required dependencies with pip
ozone/ozone-framework-python-server$ pip install -r requirements.txt

// Start the backend server
ozone/ozone-framework-python-server$ start-dev.sh
----

=== Starting OWF via Docker

.Start single app bundle
----
// From the project's root directory
ozone$ docker-compose up
----

.Start backend only
----
// Navigate to ozone-framework-python-server directory from within the cloned ozone repository
ozone$ cd ozone-framework-python-server
ozone/ozone-framework-python-server$ docker-compose up
----

==== Accessing OWF

After the backend server has finished the initialization process, and the frontend is being served, OWF can be accessed by opening a web browser and navigating to the following URL:

* http://localhost:3000/

If the single app bundle option was used, OWF can be accessed by opening a web browser and navigating to the following URL:

* http://localhost:8000/
