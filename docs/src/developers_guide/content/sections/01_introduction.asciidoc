= Introduction

== Objectives

The purpose of this guide is to explain how to create a simple widget or integrate an existing widget into the Ozone Widget Framework (OWF).


== Document Scope

This guide is written for software developers who want to change an existing application into an OWF-compatible widget(s) or understand the APIs available to them for building widgets.


== Usage

=== File References

All directory and file paths in this guide are relative to the `{path-full}/` directory.

_Example:_ The full path of `{path-server}/` would be found at `{path-full}/{path-server}/`.
[.line-through]##

=== Example Code

// TODO: Need to package documentation and examples as part of the build; update path to examples.
All of the code examples listed in this document can be found in the `{path-full}/{path-examples}/`. Previously this repository contained example widgets with source code built in different technology stacks that is no longer shipped with this bundle. These can still be found on the public `{github-legacy-sample-widgets}[Github repository]`. The examples included in the distribution are detailed in <<example-widgets>>.


== Additional Notes

=== Terminology Changes

Previous versions of the Ozone documentation used the terms "App Component" and "Applications" (or "Apps").

To maintain a consistent nomenclature across the documentation and code base, these terms are being deprecated in favor of the original terms "Widget" and "Dashboard".

=== Warnings

The following APIs are not currently supported by OWF v8:

* Logging API
* State API
* Chrome API
* Drag & Drop API

Additionally, some of the APIs in this document are out-of-date or in the process of being updated or deprecated.

If you run into problems or inconsistencies, please refer to the source code or contact the OZONE Development Team.
