= Configuration

OWF offers custom configuration options via the settings files used by Django, located in `config/settings`. Once changes are made, restart OWF to have the changes take effect.

The default settings provided in the `config/settings/production.py` file are intended for use in a local, non-production environment. For production deployment to a non-local environment or to use an external database, this file must be configured with the appropriate settings, which are explained throughout this guide.


== Help settings

When a user clicks the question mark button in the toolbar, OWF offers online help:

Out of the bundle, the Help window contains:

* Instructions for Configuring Help

=== Changing the location of help files

The help directory location is defined by the `HELP_FILES` property in `{path-to-config}`.

By default, help files are located  in the `/config/staticfiles/` directory. In the default OWF bundle, this may be found at `{app-bundle}/`.

To change the directory location, replace `HELP_FILES` and then run
`python manage.py collectstatic --settings=config.settings.production --no-input`

=== Environmental Variables (.env file)

The Environmental variables are configurations for the OWF server and client that will effect general functionality of the application in many ways.  Depending on the modifications to the configurations at are made the application can be drastically altered to fit the needs of the end user. Please see the <<env_configuration>> documentation for more information regarding the specifics to each of the configuration settings that the environmental variables provide.

NOTE: _If the user changes these environmental variables it is recommended that the OWF server is restarted, otherwise these changes wont take effect._

=== Custom Access Alert settings

Depending on the individual security requirements where OWF is being deployed, users may be required to agree to the specific terms of a security warning.

Deploying a custom security warning requires modifications to one of the files in the client application and will require a re-build of the client application. Modifications will need to be made in the `messages.ts` file located in the `ozone-framework-client/packages/application/src/environment/` directory. Once the changes have been made, follow the instructions in the *Build Guide* to re-build and deploy the client application.


== Connecting to AML (Marketplace)

In order to the connect AML Marketplace with {app-bundle}, you must modify the following files in your AML installation: +

    aml-backend\Makefile
    aml-frontend\webpack.dev.js
    aml-frontend\webpack.prod.js
    aml-frontend\src\components\shared\LaunchModal.js

Patching and possibly modifying with the files provided in the 'aml_ozone_patch.zip' compressed directory that is included with {app-bundle}.

=== Modifying AML Patch files

Within the `aml-frontend\webpack.prod.js` file, set the PERMITTED_OZONE_PARENT_DOMAIN variable equal to the URL for your OWF instance. If you wish to run the system in dev mode, make the same change in `aml-frontend\webpack.dev.js` as well.
