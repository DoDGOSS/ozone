=== Dashboards

In simple terms, a dashboard is a screen where a user can dictate which widgets to load, which layouts to use, and the arrangement of the widgets within the specified layouts. 

Each time a saved dashboard loads, the layout maintain the same look and feel as the last time the dashboard was accessed by the user.

Users can receive dashboards by the following methods:

* Create their own
* Add from the Marketplace
* Assign to individual user by an administrator
* Assign to a group by an administrator

Group-assigned dashboards provide identical layouts and widgets for each member of a group. Each group member can customize their instance of a pre-configured dashboard. dashboards that have not been created by the user can be restored to their default states.

==== Dashboards menu

The dashboard menu lists all of the user's dashboards. The dashboards included here are Ozone dashboards, either created in OWF or obtained from the Marketplace.

From the dashboard menu, users can start a dashboard, create new ones, or search for dashboards in the Marketplace. Dashboards can be shared, restored, edited or deleted through the manager buttons in the dashboard menu.

To open the dashboard menu, click the dashboard button image:dashboard_button.png[] in the OWF toolbar.

===== Opening a dashboard

Dashboards can contain one or more layouts called Pages. If a dashboard has only one page, then clicking its icon in the dashboard Menu will start it.

To open a dashboard:

. Click the dashboards Menu button in the toolbar to open the dashboards Menu.
. Click a dashboard.
.. If it has one page, it will automatically open.
.. If it has more than one page, then clicking the dashboard's icon will open a carousel displaying all the dashboards's pages.


=== Widgets

An widget is a lightweight, single-purpose application that offers a summary or limited view of a larger application or dashboard. In OWF, a widget is a global description for a piece of Web content that can be configured by the user and displayed within an dashboard.


==== Widget toolbar

Users can access their widgets from the widget toolbar by clicking the widgets button image:widgets_button.png[] in the toolbar. Once open, the Widget Toolbar appears at the left of the screen.

===== Adding a widget to a dashboard

To start a widget in a dashboard:

. Open the widget toolbar by clicking the widgets button image:widgets_button.png[] in the toolbar.
. Start a widget using one of the following methods:
** Click the widget to immediately add it to the active dashboard.
** Drag the widget from the widget Toolbar into the active dashboard. +
... The widget toolbar disappears revealing the active dashboard.
... Drop the widget in the desired location of the dashboard.
... The widget toolbar reappears after the widget has been added.
. Repeat this action to open another widget.
. When finished, close the widget toolbar by clicking the image:widget_toolbar_close_button.png[] in the upper-right corner.


=== Intents

Intents are the instructions for carrying out an widget's intentions. One widget requests an action (think of actions as verbs like view, share, edit, etc.), then another widget receives that request and performs the action. Intents build on OWF's publish / subscribe feature by allowing users to choose the widget(s) that will use data. This binding capability enables two widgets to share data in a way that improves their function.

For example, the NYSE widget charts data about the stock exchange. Some users may want to view that data as a Web page. This is possible if the NYSE widget has an Intent that tells it to send data to widgets that display data in a Web format. 

NOTE: Widgets may have multiple intents associated with them. Users cannot create widget intents. Administrators and developers (logged in as administrators) add widget intents through the OWF administrator interface. Developers also add the intents through widget descriptor URLs.


==== How to Use Intents

// TODO: Replace pictures (and review text) once Intents functionality and UI are added to the application.

When a widget sends an intent request, a pop-up window appears displaying all of the open widgets that can receive the requested intent action and data for an intended purpose (graphing, displaying, etc.).

.Widget selection dialog for intents
image::intents_dialog_1.png[]

Select a widget to accept the requested Intent:

* Click one of the widgets displayed on the window OR
* Click the widget link to send the information to a widget that is not open on the screen:

.Select an alternate widget for the intent
image::intents_dialog_2.png[]

NOTE: Checking the "Remember" box will allow the selected widget to automatically open the requesting widget's data. This function will continue until the user breaks the connection by closing either the sending or receiving widget.

After a user selects a receiving widget, the intent data is automatically sent to and processed by the receiving widget. To place the widget on the dashboard, click or drag it from the menu into the dashboard. Once the receiving widget is placed and open in the dashboard, it will receive the sending widget intent request.


=== Themes

OWF currently provides a light and a dark theme.

To toggle the selected theme:

. Click the Theme button image:theme_button.png[] in the toolbar.


=== The Marketplace

// TODO Update after Marketplace integration and UI has been completed.

The Ozone Marketplace, similar to a commercial app store, operates as a thin-client registry of applications and services. The Marketplace provides search and discovery functionality that enables OWF users to find, add and share useful tools including (but not limited to) widgets, dashboards, and web applications.

If OWF has been configured for is connected to one or more Marketplaces, the Marketplace button  allows the user to select and launch the Marketplace within the OWF user interface.

When a single Marketplace is connected, clicking the Marketplace button immediately launch the default Marketplace.

If multiple Marketplaces are connected, clicking the Marketplace button opens the Marketplace Switcher, allowing the user to select the desired Marketplace to launch.
