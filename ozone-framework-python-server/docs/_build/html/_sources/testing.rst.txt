To Ensure that the API is working as planned testing with the following tools is recommended before making commits to the
branch in development.

Testing Tools List:

* `Postman <https://www.getpostman.com/>`_

* `Python Requests <https://3.python-requests.org/>`_

Example of Python requests testing the api. The goal would be to build a script (all actions) for yourself to do automated testing of the api code you wrote:

.. code-block:: python3

    import requests
    r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
    r.status_code
    200
    r.text

Once these tools have mimicked the interactions with the server that REACT App will make we can then write our test code to
be passed in the Django test infrastructure.

More Information on the Django Rest Framework testing infrastructure can be found  `here <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/>`_
