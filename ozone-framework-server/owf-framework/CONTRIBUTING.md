# Contributor Guidelines

## General Process

1. Create a fork from the current version
2. Add commits for your changes
3. Open a pull request on Github

## Specifics

* Code should follow existing code standards i.e. line spacing, indenting, and naming conventions.
* Rebase commits for easier readability for code reviews
* When submitting your pull request, please be detailed in the description. At the minimum the request should contain the following:
	* A detailed description of new features or changes to the codebase (including changes to licenses)
	* Screen shots of any new UI features
	* Any testing information that's pertinent (browsers, environments, etc.)
	* A point of contact for technical discussions
* At the minimum please ensure that your code builds and passes the automated tests. It would be helpful if new features included new tests.
* The better documented your code is, the quicker the Ozone team will be able to process your request. Use javadocs or jsdocs as appropriate at the tops of files, functions, and methods
* Submitting a built bundle with your pull request will also help us evaluate your request.
