Sample Microsoft .Net Widget for the Ozone Widgeting Framework.

**********************************************************************
1. COMPONENTS

This example consists of one main widget page.

**********************************************************************
2. BUILDING

You must edit the following file to ensure that the JavaScript includes
all point to your instance of the OWF (default is localhost:8443):

Default.aspx

Also ensure that OWF.relayFile points to the RPC
relay file using the your web context, such as:

OWF.relayFile = '/dotnet/js/eventing/rpc_relay.uncompressed.html';

This example requires a separate web server to run the ASP.NET project, 
usually either IIS or the built-in web server that comes with Visual 
Studio 2008. Open the dotnet-widget.sln file and this project can be 
run and debugged from Visual Studio.

3. WIDGET DEFINITION IN OWF

The following lists some sample values that can be used to insert the
widget into your OWF installation, assuming that the widget is
hosted in a container (for example, IIS), running on port 80 using a 
root name of "dotnet".

4. EXAMPLE WIDGET

Widget Framework can be integrated into an ASP.NET 3.5 website. 
The example contains a web page for adding eventing channels and a 
web service for storing eventing messages.
